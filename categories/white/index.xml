      <description> I loved this wine. It&amp;rsquo;s and affordable Burgundy that&amp;rsquo;s uncomplicated and super easy to drink. Un-oaked chardonay is a totally different experience from the super oaky American chardonay varietals. It&amp;rsquo;s much more delicate, and in my opinion, more enjoyable. We had this with chicken in a mushroom cream sauce and it was delightful. I&amp;rsquo;d buy this any time, it&amp;rsquo;s become one of my go-tos.
Tasting Notes  Medium straw in color Apple, pineapple, honeysuckle Vanilla, new plastic Light body Medium Alcohol Wonderfully balanced finish, nice and crisp  </description>

      <description>A little sweet for my taste, but this would be a great intro to reisling for a non-wine drinker. I had it with a spicy curry. The sweetnest worked ok with the spiciness of the curry, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t a great pairing. I might be a good wine to serve with some salty snacks as a starter.
Tasting Notes  Medium straw in color, medium intensity Low viscosity Lots of melon, citrus, apple, and honeysuckle in the nose Some fresh cut grass on the palate Slightly minerality Sweet Light body Medium-plus acidity Medium alcohol Medium-plus finish.</description>

      <description> I liked this Chardonay. It&amp;rsquo;s very smooth-drinking from start to finish. I see this one around a lot at grocery stores and would definitely buy again. Perfect with a classic roast chicken, or any cremy sauce pasta. ðŸ‘Œ
Tasting Notes  Medium gold in color Apple, candy lemon, and melon prmiary aromas Lots of oak resin Slight minrality, new plastic/petrol Medium-minus body Light (soft) tannins Butter finish, malolactic fermentation shining through  </description>
