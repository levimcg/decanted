This wine is actually made in California by Winepress Vintners (probably part of a big conglomerate), but it _is_ made from Oregon Pinot Noir grapes. This was a really enjoyable and affordable wine and I would buy again for sure.

## Tasting Notes

- Light ruby in color with tints of brown around the edges
- Lots of fresh red fruit and floral aromas
- Light body
- Caramel and almond notes in the finish
