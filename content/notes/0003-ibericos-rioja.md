I loved this wine. Would go great with some salty snacks, or cured meats.

## Tasting Notes

- Dark ruby in color
- Black cherry, vegetal aromas
- Oaky vanilla secondary aromas and taste
- Some spice/peppery notes
- Medium tannin that come on strong at the back of the tongue
- I got a little bit of green flower, like dandelion in the finish
