This wine was OK but nothing to get too excited about. I'd be interested to taste this vintage again in a year or too once it's had a chance to mellow out.

## Tasting Notes
- 100% Tempranillo
- Dark ruby in color
- Black cherry, currants, vegetal, bell pepper
- Some oaky spiciness, with some piney resinous qualities
- Medium-plus tannin
- Medium-plus body
