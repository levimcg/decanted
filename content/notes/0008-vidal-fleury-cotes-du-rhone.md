Nothing too special about this wine. It's a cheap [GSM blend](http://winefolly.com/review/try-gsm-cotes-du-rhone-blend/). This was my first real experience of a Côte Du Rhône. It wasn't great, but definitely got me interested in the region. I'v got a few bottles from this region on my [wishlist](../../wishlist).

## Tasting Notes
- Medium-dark ruby in color
- Lost of dark fruit—blackberry, Plumb, raspberry
- Jammy, overripe, cooked fruit flavors (Maybe a hot vintage)
- A hint of rubber/plastic
- Dry, not much residual sugar
- Medium-plus body
- Medium-plus acidity almost juicy
- Medium-plus alcohol
- Light presence of tannin, no signs of oak
