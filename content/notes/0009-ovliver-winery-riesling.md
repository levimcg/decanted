A little sweet for my taste, but this would be a great intro to reisling for a non-wine drinker. I had it with a spicy curry. The sweetnest worked ok with the spiciness of the curry, but it wasn't a _great_ pairing. I might be a good wine to serve with some salty snacks as a starter.

## Tasting Notes
- Medium straw in color, medium intensity
- Low viscosity
- Lots of melon, citrus, apple, and honeysuckle in the nose
- Some fresh cut grass on the palate
- Slightly minerality
- Sweet
- Light body
- Medium-plus acidity
- Medium alcohol
- Medium-plus finish. The sweetness really lingers with some vegetal quality that comes on at the end.
