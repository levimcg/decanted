This wine was wonderfully balanced. The sweetness really plays nicely with the tannins. The cedar notes really stood out a little too much for me, but that was my only complaint. I would definitely buy this one again. Would go great with BBQ.

## Tasting Notes
- Dark ruby in color
- Initial aroma of dark fruit, black currant, mushroom, dirt
- Cedar, clove, vanilla
- Some green pepper and herbacious notes
- Medium body
- Medium-minus acidity
- Medium tannin
- Wonderful lingering finish. Stayed with me for 20â€“30 seconds with the vanilla and spice really coming on at the end.
