I loved this wine. It's and affordable Burgundy that's uncomplicated and super easy to drink. Un-oaked chardonay is a totally different experience from the super oaky American chardonay varietals. It's much more delicate, and in my opinion, more enjoyable. We had this with chicken in a mushroom cream sauce and it was delightful. I'd buy this any time, it's become one of my go-tos.
