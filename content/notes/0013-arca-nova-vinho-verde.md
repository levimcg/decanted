This was my first Vinho Verde. I loved this wine. It's super easy to drink and wonderfully ballanced. It would be amazing will some grilled white fish and a light summer salad. Excited to try more labels in this style! Oh and I picked this up for $6, which is a total steal.

## Tasting Notes
- Light to medium straw in color
- Initial aroma of crisp green apple, peach, hay/straw, fresh-cut grass
- Secondary aromas of green pepper and some floral honeysuckle notes
- Light body, with just a bit of effervescence
- Lovely initial sweetness and a perfectly balanced acidic finish with notes of citrus
