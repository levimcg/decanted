I had this wine with some spicy Indian food I made at home. It complimented the spicyness really well, but was a little sweet for my taste when I had a glass on it's own after dinner.

## Tasting Notes
- Light straw in color and crystal clear
- Pineapple, melon, honeysuckle, and spring onion initial aromas
- Some gravely mineral aromas,
- Low acidity
- Medium body
- Lots of residual sweetness and slightly acidic finish
