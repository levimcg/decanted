This wine was OKâ€”nothing too remarkable. It had too much vegetal character for my taste, but the finish was nicely balanced with a bit of redisual sweetness and a good amount of acidity.

## Tasting Notes
- Just barely dark ruby in color, more like medium-plus ruby
- Primary aroumas of black cherry and black currant
- Some vegetal aromas, specifically lots of carrot
- Sublte cedar/resin, definitely some presence of oak
- Spicy vanilla secondary aroma with some hints of clove
- Medium tannin
- Nicely balanced finish
