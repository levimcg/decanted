I think I opened this bottle at the perfect point in it's lifetime. I got it on clearance at [Jungle Jim's](http://junglejims.com/) for $20. I should have picked up a case. It was perfectly mellowed-out after 7-plus years in the bottle. It would go great with some braised or roasted lamb.

- Medium ruby with a tinge of garnet in color
