      <description>A little sweet for my taste, but this would be a great intro to reisling for a non-wine drinker. I had it with a spicy curry. The sweetnest worked ok with the spiciness of the curry, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t a great pairing. I might be a good wine to serve with some salty snacks as a starter.
Tasting Notes  Medium straw in color, medium intensity Low viscosity Lots of melon, citrus, apple, and honeysuckle in the nose Some fresh cut grass on the palate Slightly minerality Sweet Light body Medium-plus acidity Medium alcohol Medium-plus finish.</description>

      <description> I love this wine. It&amp;rsquo;s a personal favorite of my wife&amp;rsquo;s and mine. The grapes are grown about 10 miles from where we live at Creekbend Vinyard in Elletseville, Indiana. This is my go to bottle of to gift to friends and family that aren&amp;rsquo;t already wine drinkers due to how approachable and easy-drinking it is.
Tasting Notes  52% Corot, 48% Marechal Foch grapes Dried Fruit, Cherry, Raisins Medium body High fruity and juicy acidity  </description>
