      <description> This wine is actually made in California by Winepress Vintners (probably part of a big conglomerate), but it is made from Oregon Pinot Noir grapes. This was a really enjoyable and affordable wine and I would buy again for sure.
Tasting Notes  Light ruby in color with tints of brown around the edges Lots of fresh red fruit and floral aromas Light body Caramel and almond notes in the finish  </description>
